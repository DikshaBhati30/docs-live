Then, structure your main body **thematically**, drawing from both global and regional works under each theme.\n\n---\n\n### üìò **Recommended Structure**:\n\n#### 1. **Introduction to Literature Review**\n\n- Briefly explain your purpose.\n    \n- Define scope (themes, geography, time period).\n    \n- Mention that you'll review both global and regional literature, then organize the rest thematically.\n    \n\n#### 2. **Global Literature Review**\n\n- Highlight global debates, concepts, and frameworks.\n    \n- Focus on how your broader topic (e.g., habitat change, socio-ecological transitions) has been studied globally.\n    \n\n#### 3. **Regional Literature Review**\n\n- Focus on Ladakh, Changthang, Himalayas.\n    \n- Point out what's been done locally, methods used, and key findings.\n    \n\n#### 4. **Thematic & Chronological Review**\n\nOrganize by themes **(Theme 1, Theme 2, etc.)**, and within each theme:\n\n- Start with older foundational work.\n    \n- Move to recent findings.\n    \n- Contrast global and regional literature where relevant.\n    \n\n**Example:**\n\n**Theme 1: Pastoral Mobility and Landscape Use**\n\n- Global: Studies from Mongolia, Andes, etc.\n    \n- Regional: Ladakh-specific works.\n    \n- Show temporal shifts: colonial, post-independence, current.\n    \n\n**Theme 2: Ecological Transitions and Climate Change**\n\n- Same method: global to local, old to new.\n    \n\n#### 5. **Gap in Literature**\n\n- Based on the above, show what hasn‚Äôt been done:\n    \n    - Lack of integrated socio-ecological analyses in Changthang.\n        \n    - Little attention to lived experience post-wildlife protection laws.\n        \n    - Poor inclusion of oral histories, etc.\n        \n\n---\n\n### üìå Tips:\n\n- Use Zotero or Obsidian to tag notes by **theme** and **region**.\n    \n- Use tables or matrices to organize readings.\n    \n- Don‚Äôt just summarize ‚Äî **compare, contrast, and critique**.\n    \n- End each theme with a reflection: ‚ÄúWhat this means for my research.‚Äù\n"}
