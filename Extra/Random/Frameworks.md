# Integrated Framework Strategy for Changthang Thesis

## 1. SLF + Political Ecology
- **Why?** SLF is people-centered but often apolitical.
- **Combination Power:** Use SLF to map assets/livelihood strategies + Political Ecology to examine who controls access to those assets and how power affects vulnerability.
- **Example:** A herder may have land (natural capital), but political boundaries or conservation laws may restrict its use.

---

## 2. SLF + Resilience Framework
- **Why?** SLF captures current livelihood status; Resilience adds a time-based lens (how people cope, adapt, transform).
- **Combination Power:** Track how livelihood strategies evolve in response to pasture degradation or tourism influx over time.
- **Example:** Changes in livestock composition, out-migration, or tourism employment as adaptive responses.

---

## 3. SES Framework + Commons Theory
- **Why?** SES helps you model the system; Commons Theory lets you assess resource governance within that system.
- **Combination Power:** SES shows the feedbacks (e.g., overgrazing â†’ pasture decline â†’ reduced herd size), while Commons Theory analyzes institutional robustness (rules, conflict resolution).
- **Example:** How well Changthangâ€™s traditional governance (e.g., goba system) manages rangelands under modern stressors.

---

## 4. Political Ecology + Vulnerability Framework
- **Why?** Political Ecology critiques structure; Vulnerability Framework quantifies impact on people.
- **Combination Power:** Reveal how structural inequalities (e.g., gender, caste, remoteness) lead to differing vulnerabilities.
- **Example:** Women herders may be more exposed to workload shifts post-migration, but less involved in decision-making.

---

## 5. Landscape Approach + SES or Resilience
- **Why?** Landscape Approach is spatial and stakeholder-focused; SES/Resilience help model system dynamics.
- **Combination Power:** Understand trade-offs across scalesâ€”between conservation, tourism, and local livelihoodsâ€”while tracking system change or thresholds.
- **Example:** How development in Hanle for tourism affects yak herding and migratory grazing routes.

---

## 6. Final Integration Strategy
**Core Anchor:** Start with SLF to map livelihoods.  
**Then Layer:**
- Political Ecology â†’ for power & access dynamics
- Resilience â†’ for temporal change/adaptation
- SES + Commons â†’ for ecological-social feedback & governance
- Vulnerability â†’ for who suffers most, and why
- Landscape â†’ for spatial and policy-level negotiation

ðŸ“Œ You donâ€™t need to apply all frameworks uniformly. Assign **different frameworks to different sub-questions or chapters** based on relevance.

# Integrated Framework Table â€“ Changthang Thesis

| Core Framework | Supplementary Framework | How They Complement Each Other | Application in Changthang |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **SLF** | **Political Ecology** | SLF focuses on assets/strategies but ignores power. Political Ecology reveals how access/control is shaped by politics and institutions. | Analyze how state policies (e.g., wildlife protection) restrict traditional herding despite asset availability. |
| **SLF** | **Resilience Framework** | SLF is static; Resilience adds a dynamic, temporal lensâ€”how livelihoods respond to shocks over time. | Track how pastoralist households adapt to pasture decline, climate variability, and new tourism-based opportunities. |
| **SES** | **Commons Theory (Ostrom)** | SES maps system feedbacks; Commons Theory provides detailed institutional rules for managing shared resources. | Assess how herders manage grazing land, water, and migratory routes under climate and policy pressures. |
| **Political Ecology** | **Vulnerability Framework** | Political Ecology explains causes of inequality; Vulnerability shows how these inequalities impact different groups. | Examine why certain social groups (e.g., women, small herders) are more vulnerable to habitat and economic shifts. |
| **Landscape Approach** | **SES / Resilience** | Landscape is spatial/multi-stakeholder; SES/Resilience add feedback, thresholds, and change mechanisms. | Explore trade-offs in land use between tourism, conservation, and traditional herding across the Changthang landscape. |
| **Commons Theory** | **Resilience Framework** | Commons Theory shows rules; Resilience shows how flexible and adaptive those rules are under change. | Study how traditional institutions adapt their norms (e.g., seasonal grazing restrictions) in times of crisis. |
