### 4.0 Discussion

This section interprets the demographic and household composition trends in the Nyoma and Durbok blocks of Changthang between 2001 and 2011, based on census data. The discussion integrates spatial, temporal, social, and ecological dimensions, highlighting significant patterns and their broader implications for policy and planning in the high-altitude pastoralist context of Ladakh.

#### 4.1 Demographic Stability and Hidden Spatial Divergence

While the overall population of the 18 studied villages showed near-stasis—from 11,085 in 2001 to 11,118 in 2011 (+0.30%)—this surface-level continuity obscures contrasting block-wise trajectories. Nyoma block recorded a population decline of 3.03%, while Durbok witnessed a growth of 8.77%. These divergent patterns suggest differentiated exposure to socio-economic and ecological forces. Factors such as remoteness, road connectivity, tourism, and proximity to military installations likely played key roles (Bhasin, 2012; Ahmed, 2004).

Village-level data revealed both population shrinkage (e.g., Kharnak -42.09%) and growth (e.g., Chumathang +25.93%), indicating uneven development. Such differentiation often reflects access to services, changing livelihood strategies, and ecological constraints (Jamwal et al., 2020).

#### 4.2 Feminization of the Population

A notable regional transformation is the sharp rise in sex ratio—from 936 in 2001 to 1,077 in 2011. Nyoma block saw a remarkable jump from 922 to 1,104. This feminization suggests male out-migration for employment, education, or army service—common in high-altitude Himalayan regions (Rizvi, 1999). The growing proportion of women has implications for labor burdens, decision-making, and access to services, especially in the absence of robust social support systems.

Chumathang and Nyoma villages exemplify this trend. Chumathang's sex ratio surged from 691 to 1,704, likely due to male migration and a corresponding rise in female-headed households. Feminization of demographic structures in pastoral economies is both a reflection and a driver of socio-cultural change (Goodall, 2004).

#### 4.3 Household Consolidation and Socio-Economic Stress

Between 2001 and 2011, the total number of households fell from 2,516 to 2,165, while average household size rose from 4.41 to 5.13 persons. This indicates significant household consolidation. In Nyoma village, households decreased by 42%, while average size rose by over 34%. Such consolidation is likely a response to economic pressures, reduced access to rangelands, and infrastructural limits, leading families to co-reside (Bhatnagar et al., 2006).

Some villages like Demjok show household fragmentation (increase in number, decrease in size), while others like Kharnak, Mood, and Tarchit show large-scale consolidation. These patterns signal the emergence of new social arrangements shaped by declining resources, climate variability, and migration (Pandit et al., 2024).

#### 4.4 Transformation in Social Composition

The region remains predominantly Scheduled Tribe (ST), with STs comprising 81.41% of the population in 2011. However, Nyoma block experienced a decrease in ST proportion from 77.29% to 73.45%. Villages such as Anlay and Koyul exhibited notable declines in ST share, suggesting socio-demographic changes possibly linked to the settlement of Tibetan refugees, intermarriage, or reclassification processes (Jina, 1995; Rawat & Adhikari, 2006).

ST feminization also emerged as a significant trend. In 2011, Nyoma block’s ST female population outnumbered males (2,988 vs. 2,682), again pointing to male mobility and restructuring of labor and domestic roles within tribal pastoralist systems.

#### 4.5 Literacy and Educational Attainments

Literacy trends in the region reveal substantial progress, especially among women. The total number of literates increased across most villages, with female literacy making significant strides. This change reflects the impact of targeted educational schemes and shifting societal norms (Bhasin, 2012).

However, gender disparities persist. In 2001, male literacy was significantly higher than female literacy across both blocks. By 2011, while the gap narrowed, it still persisted. For example, Nyoma village saw a rise in overall literacy, but much of the increase was skewed towards males. In contrast, Chumathang recorded a sharp increase in female literacy, mirroring its overall demographic and socio-economic growth trajectory.

These patterns suggest that while structural investments in education have taken root, more focused interventions are needed to sustain female literacy gains and improve access to secondary and higher education in remote areas (Rawat & Adhikari, 2006).

#### 4.6 Workforce Participation and Economic Shifts

The working population data indicates a dynamic shift in livelihood strategies. While agriculture and livestock remain dominant, there is a notable increase in marginal workers—especially women. This increase in female marginal workers may be attributed to seasonal labor, informal service sectors, and expanded roles in pastoral production due to male migration (Rizvi, 1999; Bhatnagar et al., 2006).

Villages such as Nyoma and Karzok reported an increase in main and marginal female workers between 2001 and 2011. This underscores a slow but steady transformation in the region’s gendered division of labor. Yet, the prevalence of marginal over main workers points to underemployment, income instability, and the absence of secure livelihood options.

Workforce trends also highlight the integration of some households into wage labor markets linked to army logistics, border road work, or tourism in select areas like Pangong.

#### 4.7 Interlinkages with Habitat and Ecological Change

The demographic and socio-economic shifts documented in this study are closely tied to ecological changes in the Changthang region. As household sizes increase and populations concentrate in fewer settlements, pressure on nearby rangelands, water sources, and grazing routes intensifies. This is particularly critical given the region’s fragile alpine steppe ecosystem, which is already under stress from overgrazing, declining snowmelt, and erratic precipitation patterns (Rawat & Adhikari, 2006; Jamwal et al., 2020).

Feminization of the labor force and the growing role of marginal workers also suggest a diversification of subsistence strategies, potentially leading to shifts in land-use patterns. Sedentarization of formerly nomadic households may reduce rotational grazing practices, contributing to rangeland degradation (Goodall, 2004).

Furthermore, the loss of population in ecologically sensitive areas such as Kharnak risks both habitat abandonment and cultural erosion. Abandoned settlements can alter wildlife movement and local ecological dynamics, while increased dependence on centralised infrastructure (e.g., for water or fodder) creates new ecological footprints in growth villages like Chumathang.

In sum, demographic and economic transitions in Changthang are not isolated human processes; they are intricately interwoven with ongoing transformations in landscape ecology and must be addressed through integrated socio-ecological planning.

#### 4.8 Implications for Policy and Planning

These demographic shifts present both challenges and opportunities:

* **Migration and Livelihoods**: Out-migration of youth and men may destabilize traditional pastoral systems. However, it also opens space for alternative livelihood schemes led by women.
* **Gender-sensitive Interventions**: Increasing feminization necessitates gender-sensitive policy responses in education, healthcare, and social security.
* **Household Support Structures**: The rise in household sizes demands infrastructure for housing, sanitation, and food access tailored to larger co-residing units.
* **Educational Access**: Expand investment in residential schools, female teacher recruitment, and vocational education aligned with regional livelihoods.
* **Employment Schemes**: MGNREGA-type programs could be tailored to high-altitude settings, addressing underemployment and enhancing rural incomes.
* **Ecological Integration**: Policies must be designed to sustain rangeland ecology, integrate mobility-based pastoralism, and promote community-based conservation in settlement planning.
* **Village Typologies**: Variations in demographic trajectories suggest the need for village-specific interventions—supporting growth centers like Chumathang, while designing revitalization schemes for declining settlements like Kharnak.

The Changthang region, at the nexus of climate fragility, strategic significance, and socio-cultural transformation, warrants a multi-scalar planning approach. Demographic data must not be seen in isolation but understood within the broader ecological, political, and cultural context of Ladakh’s changing landscape.
