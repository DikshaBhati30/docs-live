## üîÑ Interlinked Frameworks ‚Äì Roles & Interactions

### 1. Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF)

- **Core Focus**: Household assets, strategies, and outcomes
    
- **Strengths**:
    
    - Micro-level, actor-focused
        
    - Classifies assets (natural, social, human, financial, physical)
        
- **Gaps**:
    
    - Lacks power/political context
        
    - Poor temporal adaptation
        
- **Linked With**:
    
    - _Political Ecology_ (adds power/conflict)
        
    - _Resilience Framework_ (adds change/adaptation over time)

### 2. Political Ecology

- **Core Focus**: Power, access, governance, institutions
    
- **Strengths**:
    
    - Exposes marginalization, state-citizen-environment dynamics
        
    - Explains causes behind ecological degradation/conflict
        
- **Gaps**:
    
    - Weak on practical livelihoods and feedback dynamics
        
- **Linked With**:
    
    - _SLF_ (for local livelihood insight)
        
    - _Vulnerability Framework_ (for impact distribution)
        
    - _Landscape Approach_ (for spatial power struggles)
        

---

### 3. Socio-Ecological Systems (SES)

- **Core Focus**: Feedback loops between ecological and social systems
    
- **Strengths**:
    
    - System-wide, dynamic modeling
        
    - Handles thresholds, regime shifts
        
- **Gaps**:
    
    - Complex, less actor-centered
        
- **Linked With**:
    
    - _Resilience_ (to understand shocks & recovery)
        
    - _Commons Theory_ (to ground SES in local rules)
        

---

### 4. Resilience Framework

- **Core Focus**: System capacity to absorb, adapt, transform
    
- **Strengths**:
    
    - Captures temporal change, recovery from shocks
        
- **Gaps**:
    
    - Not power-sensitive
        
- **Linked With**:
    
    - _SES_ (to model system behavior)
        
    - _SLF_ (for adaptive strategies)
        
    - _Commons Theory_ (for institutional adaptability)
        

---

### 5. Commons Theory (Ostrom)

- **Core Focus**: Governance of shared natural resources
    
- **Strengths**:
    
    - Clear institutional analysis
        
    - Community-based resource management
        
- **Gaps**:
    
    - Limited in broader political and economic critique
        
- **Linked With**:
    
    - _Resilience_ (for rule flexibility)
        
    - _SES_ (for ecological feedback)
        
    - _Political Ecology_ (to uncover larger constraints)
        

---

### 6. Vulnerability Framework

- **Core Focus**: Who is exposed, sensitive, and lacks adaptive capacity?
    
- **Strengths**:
    
    - Centered on equity, social differentiation
        
- **Gaps**:
    
    - Doesn‚Äôt address causes (only outcomes)
        
- **Linked With**:
    
    - _Political Ecology_ (for causal analysis)
        
    - _SLF_ (for coping strategies)
        

---

### 7. Landscape Approach

- **Core Focus**: Multi-scalar, spatially explicit trade-offs in land use
    
- **Strengths**:
    
    - Useful for mapping stakeholder tensions
        
    - Spatially grounded
        
- **Gaps**:
    
    - Doesn‚Äôt inherently account for feedbacks or inequality
        
- **Linked With**:
    
    - _SES_ (for dynamic mapping)
        
    - _Political Ecology_ (for spatial justice and policy power)

## üîó Overall Synergy

- **Power + Strategy + System Feedback**: Political Ecology √ó SLF √ó SES
    
- **Adaptation + Rules + Space**: Resilience √ó Commons √ó Landscape
    
- **Justice + Practice**: Vulnerability √ó SLF √ó Political Ecology
