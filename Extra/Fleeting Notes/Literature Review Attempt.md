Note: Article has information of historical aspect of urbanization in Leh, there is a focus on using satellite imagery and field visits for their method to analyse built up area difference in the town and how that is causing imbalance to the socioecological fabric of the town. Used census data for population distribution since 1901. The table is useful for the information on population distribution in Leh on the whole when you write about your blocks you can use it. 

4.1.1. Urban expansion into barren land

By 2003, new settlements were developed as residential and administrative quarters, resulting in a drastic increase of buildings to about 11,800. The eastern rim of Leh is characterised by the conversion of vast areas of barren land into concretised environment, as can be detected in the case of Skampari, a new administrative and residential area to the east of the old town. Latest developments until 2017 here
show a designation of built-up areas further east from Skampari, only detectable as road networks (Fig. 4). Entirely new quarters have further been constructed in the south-eastern and western sections of the valley, many of which are military settlements. While most quarters show regular and planned patterns, a few new ones like the Tibetan refugee settlement in the southernmost part of Leh Valley and the area
on the hill adjoining the bus station, display unplanned structures. 

**(related to changpas moving out of the villages this could be the reason for change in sex ratio)** Entirely new quarters on the southern outskirts of Leh, such as Housing Colony (also called Deskyid Tsal), Skalsangling, and Ibex Colony (also called Murtse) (Fig. 5), have expanded rapidly since the 1990′s. These quarters primarily accommodate a large number of permanently settled migrants from rural Ladakh, including nomadic groups (Goodall, 2004), and an estimated large number of temporary work migrants. Expansion
of administrative infrastructure into barren land is also reflected by large school complexes, like Lamdon School east of Sankar, built after 1973.

For centuries, mountain communities have depended upon high-altitude pastures (HAPs) in various systems of transhumant pastoralism and agropastoralism to secure their livelihoods. Altitudinal movements according to the seasonal availability of grazing resources and efficient utilisation of pastures reflect the adaptive strategies developed by communities to safeguard fodder security under specific ecological, socio-economic and political conditions

==In the Trans-Himalayan region of Leh, Ladakh (India), a cold-dry region with many remote parts, agropastoralism has been the mainstay since time immemorial ensuring a sustainable food production system relying on limited local resources (Gazetteer [1890](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13570-023-00289-1#ref-CR22 "Gazetteer. 1890.
