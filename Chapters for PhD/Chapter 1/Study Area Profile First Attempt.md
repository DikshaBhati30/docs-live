# Study Area Profile: [[Changthang]], Ladakh

Study Area is of prime importance in Geography as a spatial discipline. A study area profile is a key tool that aids in understanding the conceptual background of the area under investigation for in-depth research. This chapter serves as an introduction to [[Changthang]], highlighting its administrative background, the physical environment, and the socio-economic characteristics of the region. These aspects are crucial precursors to the research, providing a fundamental understanding of the region's significance.

# 1. Introduction

The study area of [[Changthang]], also called the Northern Plains, lies in Eastern Ladakh and represents the South Western-most extension of the Tibetan Plateau. The region extends into India in the Union Territory of Ladakh. The northern plains of [[Changthang]] constitute a vast desert-steppe area covering approximately 40% of Ladakh’s landmass and is a distinct biogeographical zone. @Humbert-Droz, 2023, @WWF-India 2007 framework report. The region is dotted with lakes and traversed by the headwaters of two major South Asian rivers, the Indus and Sutlej (Parang Chu River). The region has three major lake basins: Tsomoriri, Tsokar and Pangong Tso. Changthang lies in district Leh of the recently recognised Union Territory of Ladakh. District Leh has nine community development blocks out of which Nyoma and Durbok are part of Changthang. These two blocks comprises a total of 23 villages as per the 2011 census. @DCH2011PartA

# 2. Research Rationale

## 2.1 Rationale for the Selection of the Research Topic

Divide it into two parts (Justification for studying ecological landscape mapping, Importance of habitat changes analysis, Relevance of socio-economic transformation study and Research gaps and contribution) 

## 2.2 Rationale for the Selection of Study Area

# 3. Historical Background

	 In the first paragraph explain Changthang's Origins, using the gazetteers and the book antiquities of Indian Tibet , What does the present govt call your region?
	 
	  In second paragraph, write the historical background, the oldest inscriptions to the medieval kings and the modern rulers and the colonial time,  and the control of the state under the present government 

----

# 4. Administrative Background

Question: should I write this section according to the current subdivisions of the union territory or stick to 2011 census data? There is a lot of change in the new administrative divisions. Earlier version of the study area profile had the data from the 2011 census. 
## 4.1 Administrative Boundary

	Explain the location of the main district, explain the boundaries international, state, district and the natural barriers like rivers and mountain ranges, neighbouring areas on all sides be named, geographical area extent, lat long




Note: Also add a map of the administrative boundary of Ladakh as a UT and explain the new setup 

## 4.2 Administrative Setup

	This paragraph will include the govt of India sanctioned administrtaive setup, when was the district made, district names, subdivisions, police sations, community developemnt block, municipality wards, census towns and inhabited villages, due to recent changes you have to add the former administratvie set up in detail, since the 2011 census is your base for the secondary data and then add the present context, if the changes are avaialble in government documents mention them. 
 
## 4.3 Location of Study Area

	The following paragraph includes description of the physical location of the subdivisions and or cd blokcs in focus, if they are surrounded by a river or a mountain range, the coordinates of the cd blocks or the tehsil headqurters, information about the lat longs passing through the region 
	Give simple infromation about the census satistics such as no of households in the chosen cd blocks, no of muinicipalities, tehsils, census towns, wards, and villages, the total geographical area of the study area in comparison to the district, total population as per the most recent census data

# 5. Physical Background: 

	 Introduce what do you mean by physical background and what all features you are explaining
	 Add a Map of the study area showing the basic categories of Land use and Land Cover "Titled: Land Use And Land Cover Map Of The Study Area"

## 5.1 Geology:

	This includes information on the morpho and litho stratigraphy of the region, find a reliable source, I have limited information about this, it will take some time
	describe and explain what you know about ladakh first, changthang specific information might not be readily available
	describe and explain the landforms present in the region in detail, types of the concerned landforms, rock formation and types and its details, explain endogenic and exogenic landform processes in detail, 
	 Describe the tectonic processes, faults and folds
	 add A map of the gelogical landscape of the study area from a relaible source or make one yourself in QGIS

## 5.2 Relief:

	Explain the physiography of the region, the mountain systesm and its zones, its glacial topography, the erosion and depositional features of the glacier landforms, river that flow throgh the region and the places that they flow next, any regional disaster related issues like floods and landslides, the elevation of the region to be explained as well, including the average height of the region
	there will also be a surface relief map of the region added to this section, titled "Surface Relief Map of Changthang", source " "
## 5.3 Drainage:

	This will include an explanation about the river system of the region, what type, where they originate, whether they are snow fed, where they enter and exit the study area and what happens to the rivers in its ongoing stages 
	Explain all the river systems in detail
	There needs to be a table titled " Major River Systems of the district"
	There is also going to be a map of the system titled " Drainage System of Changthang"
	 This is how the table looks like: 

| S.NO | Name of River | Source | Local Name | Length | Basin Area | Mouth | Tributaries | Basic Features |
| ---- | ------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ----- | ----------- | -------------- |
|      |               |        |            |        |            |       |             |                |

## 5.4 Climate:

	Explain what you already know about the region's Climate @IMD Tables for Leh 
### 4.4.1 Temperature:
### 4.4.2 Rainfall:
