I am scared of the future. If I work for one week I can still get things under control. I have to write a chapter and I have most of the material. 

A blueprint with topics and timeline is essential.

I also have to get my documents in order. Your intuition can not be clearer about this. All academic documents related to PhD first priority. Then other degrees they can be kept separately. Follow the notes in the file about how to do this. It is in the file with a yellow page.
