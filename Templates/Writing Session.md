## Writing Session  
*Turn notes into thesis content — one step at a time*
### Date: {{date}}  

### Thesis Chapter / Section  
Which part of your thesis are you working on?  
```
e.g., Chapter 2 – Climate and Livelihoods in Changthang  
```

### Notes I’m Using Today  
List or link the reading notes you're using as input:  
```
- [[Climate_Adaptation_Changthang_2021]]  
- [[MigrationPatterns2022]]  
```


### Today’s Writing Goal  
Set one small, clear goal. Choose **just one**:
```
- [ ] Write a paragraph explaining one concept  
- [ ] Rewrite and clean up a messy section  
- [ ] Connect two readings with your own comment  
- [ ] Add citations to a draft section  
```

### Quick Outline / Brain Dump  
Before writing, jot down rough bullet points of what you want to say. No perfect sentences here:  
```
- Snowfall patterns are changing  
- This affects yak grazing routes  
- Two authors support this: Tashi (2020), Dorje (2018)  
```

---

### Writing Draft (Start here)  
Now turn the bullet points above into full sentences or a paragraph:  
```
Write freely. You can clean it later. Use your own words.  
```

---

### Citations Tip (Zotero-friendly)  
To add Zotero citations:  
- Use this format: @authorYear  
- Add page numbers like this: @tashi2020, p.45  
- Never paste quotes without noting page numbers  
- Always write *why* the quote matters to your argument

### What I Accomplished Today  
Reflect briefly:  
```
- What did I actually get done?  
- Even 1 paragraph or sentence counts.  
```

---

### What’s Left / What to Do Next  
Write a simple “next move” so your future self can pick it up easily:  
```
- Still need to connect this paragraph to the next section  
- Find 1 more source on pastoral migration  
- Rephrase the last sentence to make it clearer  
```

---

### Emotional Check-In  
How did today feel? Any resistance or small win you want to remember?  
```
e.g., Felt slow at first, but happy I got started. Still anxious about clarity, but it’s progress.  
```
