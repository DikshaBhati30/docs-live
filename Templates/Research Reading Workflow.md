âœ… *Best practices for citation integrity*  
```
- Always collect source in Zotero first  
- Use citekeys (e.g., @lastnameYear) in your Obsidian notes  
- If quoting directly, add page number (e.g., @gupta2021, p.34)  
- Use the Obsidian-Zotero plugin or manually paste the citekey  
- Donâ€™t use source content in your thesis until itâ€™s been turned into a permanent note
```

### âœ… To Do  
- [ ] Add source to Zotero
