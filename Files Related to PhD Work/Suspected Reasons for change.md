### 1. **Sex ratio: migration, male dominated migration in the region: find papers that tell the same, data says something like this. 

Imbalanced sex ratios can indicate gender-based discrimination, skewed birth rates, or migration trends, I have not looked for birth rates so explain with migration for now and if still a question figure it out later.  

A rising sex ratio may reflect better health care, education, and reduced gender bias > what is going in Changthang now, 2011 census data is a bit old. 

Skewed sex ratios due to male-dominated migration (e.g., in border or pastoral regions) can reshape household structures and labor divisions, this seems like the reason for now.

### 2.Â **Population Growth and Change**

This one is also without birth rates so just find other papers that relate to this: 

**Definition**: Change in total population over time due to births, deaths, and migration.
You need your own definition from census. 

**Transformation Insight**:

Declining or rising growth rates signal socio-economic shifts (e.g., better access to health care, changing fertility behavior, urban pull factors).

Migration-induced population change often reflects shifts in livelihood patterns, conflict, environmental change, or infrastructure development.
