"6.5.5 Livestock grazing

Many regions of the world are interested in the spread of grazing disturbance regimes by livestock. The effects on the structure and functioning of landscapes are dramatic. Domestic grazers create landscape patterns with a different environmental impact according to the conditions in which they are reared. This disturbance is density dependent and plant adaptation to grazing is strictly linked to the severity of the disturbance. Often, when the density of grazers is high, other effects are added, such as trampling and increasing of the soil nitrogen.

Landscapes react promptly to grazing regimes, modifying the plant community. Under a moderate grazing regime, the plant diversity is enhanced but when the grazing pressure increases, a quick drop in diversity is experienced in the plant cover. Often, as in most of the US Western grasslands, the modifications of plant mosaic have been so severe that shrubby steppes have replaced annual and perennial grasslands. With different the extensions and entities of mountain prairies across Europe, they have experienced grazing pressure for many centuries that has deeply modified composition and spatial arrangement of vegetation patch types."
