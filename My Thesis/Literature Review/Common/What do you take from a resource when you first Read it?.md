**This is my answer to this question: 
	1. Who is the author? What are they researching on? Their contribution to the field? If the work that they do is politically inclined? 
	2. What is the thesis of their research? 
	3. What is their argument? 
	4. What is their method, framework or methodology? 
	5. What are the themes discussed, and which debates do they engage with in their work?
	6. What do they recommend?**
