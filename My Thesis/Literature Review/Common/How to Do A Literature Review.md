## What is literature Review
- Review of current Available literature in your own words from credible resources with citations 


### How to do it 
- Find the papers 
	- Recent is better 
	- Peer reviewed is better 
	- High impact factor 



Step1 : Have a crystal Cut definition of what you think about your keyword 

example : Ecological Landscape 

Now how to reach till the crystal clear definition.
- Break the main keyword into it's smaller chunks 
```mermaid
graph LR
A[Ecological Landscape] --> B[Geography]
A --> C[Ecology]
B --> B1[Biogeogrpahy]
B --> B2[Cultural Geography]
B --> B3[Political Economy]
B --> B4[Political Ecology]

	
C --> C1[Socio Ecological Landscape ]


```



Now come to **your own** definition of the keyword. 




### Step 2 : 
- What do I want to find from the papers (also check [[What do you take from a resource when you first Read it?]])



```mermaid
graph TD
A{Literature Review } -->  B[Find Papers related to keyword]
B --> C[Choose Paper]
C --> D[Why should we read the whole paper]
D --> E[Good Enough]
D --> F[Okaish]
F --> G[Ignore as less amount of time  ]
E --> H[Draft Note]

```


```mermaid
graph TD 
A[Define] --> B[find and read]
B --> A
```
