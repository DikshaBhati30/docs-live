## Use a Zettelkasten/Obsidian system to organise and remember_ what you read

This is a **knowledge management method** that mirrors how your brain works â€” through **connections**, not just storage.

### ðŸ”¹ What is Zettelkasten?

- A system of **atomic notes**: Each note has **only one idea** or concept.
- Notes are **interlinked** like a web â€” you build your own personal **network of knowledge**.

### ðŸ”¸ How to Use It with Obsidian

**Step 1: One Source = One Summary Note**

- Title: `Author Year - Title of Paper`
    
- Include:
    
    - Brief summary (3â€“5 lines)
        
    - Key arguments
        
    - Relevant quotes
        
    - Citation info
        
    - Tags (e.g., `#ecology`, `#pastoralism`, `#Changthang`, etc.)
        

**Step 2: Break it Down into Atomic Notes**  
For example, from one paper:

- `Pastoral mobility and land tenure`
    
- `Effect of border militarization on yak herders`
    
- `Snow leopards and changing prey patterns`
    

Each of these gets its own **note** with:

- Summary in your words
    
- Link back to the source note
    
- Your thoughts or how it links to your thesis
    

**Step 3: Link Notes Together**

- Example: If you have one note on `climate vulnerability` and another on `government schemes`, you can **link them**:  
    âžœ In Obsidian: `[[climate vulnerability]]` in the `government schemes` note

### ðŸ”¹ Why It Works

- Mimics your brain's **non-linear** thinking
- Helps you **remember** because you're processing and reshaping ideas
- When you write your thesis, youâ€™ll have a **network of connected ideas** ready
