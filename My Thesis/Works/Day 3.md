What did I do yesterday [[My Thesis/Works/Day 2]]
- We did some structuring of my obsidian with Abhishek's help. It looks much better now. The unsorted files are in Extra folder.
- We have an ongoing structure of the literature review and the thesis structure. 
- Started explaining the first part of the title under ![[Ecological Landscape ]]
