**“We know today that self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed. Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long-and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organization of writing and note-taking comes into play.”

- I was unable to do anything because I am overwhelmed and emotional. This state of mind put me in conflict with Abhishek for a while. But I am proud of my recovery from this. This situation however took my working hours from me. 
- We also went to vasant vihar for salon appointment and returned at 10.
- Dinner was outside and so it was just fast food and a bit of sugarcane juice.
