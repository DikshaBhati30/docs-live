![[My Musts related to work#Always Write a To-do for Tomorrow]]


## To Do:  
- I do not know what will come out, but it will be productive. I will keep aside my assumptions and just follow this process.

```


- Go through the data you produced --> Find your own connections and possible reasons --> this is produce a rough draft --> now you pick five important resources to review and write from them for the discussion section, Take 25 mins only --> Fleeting Notes â†’ Literature notes â†’ Connection making â†’ Final writing.
- Break from 11:09 a.m. to 11:14 a.m. 
- 11.36: I spent time writing down the expected changes.  
- Tasks for cleaning and breakfast: drink coffee, poo, exercise, and bath.
- Back at desk by: 1:00 p.m.
- One hour late. 

---------

- Time: 2:17 pm.
- For the PPT make slides according to the changes you were asked to do. 
- Even better would be to write only 500 words for each topic on the white board. So that you can share it with your professors.

This is the part from the SAP Second Draft that needs filling into. However, at the moment, the last draft is what will be used to show changes. I had not yet figured out how to join the two for a proper final draft. Only look at this after the tasks on the board are finished 
# 6. Socio-economic Background

## 6.1 Demographic Characteristics:
## 6.2 Literacy Status and Sex Composition:
## 6.3 Religion and Caste Composition:
## 6.4 Occupational Structure:
## 6.5 Infrastructural Facilities: 

Note: also add health and education institutes, and law enforcement facilities

# 7. Discussion: 

-------


Direction: 
1. Do the second part of the work first. Start from answering the tasks on the board and then what you have made above. 
2. Let's take out the print-out that you have. Time to mess it up. 
3. Let's make connections for the draft.

Migration towards the major cities has increased in recent years. Out of the 150 families interviewed, 26 reported that 1â€“4 members of the family, 58 people in total, had migrated recently. Approximately 1,000 people had already migrated to Leh and its surrounding areas between 1962 and 2013. According to the respondents, lack of employment is the major reason for migration, followed by lack of facilities for childrenâ€™s education and lack of health care services in the area. Lack of other basic amenities such as shortage of water during winter, electricity, and transportation is also influencing the decision to migrate to major cities.
The governmentâ€™s efforts to provide subsidized feed, fodder, and medication for livestock has not proved effective in stopping migration. The rapid development in the area indicates that the continuous efforts of the government to provide all basic amenities such as food, education, and health care services has not been sufficient to improve the traditional life of nomads. Many nomadic settlements in the surveyed areas still have no electricity, most experience a shortage of potable water, and most lack good educational institutions in nearby areas.

Out-Migration is the main factor for changes in the rural demography of this region. Why do they move, and what attracts them, and what is lacking at the base village? How long have they been moving is not of concern at the moment.

- Change in strategy: 
- Make a list of all outliers and only explain those after explaining the total and block level data.

Not making any ppt.
I will share with them my new document.
