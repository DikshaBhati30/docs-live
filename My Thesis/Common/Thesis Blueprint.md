This page will include a detailed view of your thesis chapters and all their subsections. 
This blueprint will be used to assign time and deadlines to the subtasks. As only 5 months remain and I have to also coordinate with Sir about the subsections I make this should be done immediately. 

Consult this note on [[How To Write A Thesis]] for the thesis structure.
