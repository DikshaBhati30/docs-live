Divide it into two parts (Justification for studying ecological landscape mapping, Importance of habitat changes analysis, Relevance of socio-economic transformation study and Research gaps and contribution) 

## 1.2 Selection of Study Area

The nomadic-pastoralists of Changthang lead a very challenging life, daring below minus five to minus thirty-five degrees temperature during winters. Life has never been easy to them; year after year shepherding in such chilling winters is arduous. Multiplying their challenges are the adjustment to the modern pace of the world. Already a trying nomadic life invaded by the necessities of the modern world comes together to form the saga of their being in today’s ‘new’ Ladakh. It is an established fact that Mountainous areas are the most environmentally fragile ecosystems in the world. It encompasses a harsh environment within which is very unstable and unsuitable for agrarian cultivation. The primary reason is a very cold and dry climate together with difficult terrain makes it unyielding for agriculture. Therefore, as an adaptation Nomadic pastoralism has been the only way of surviving in the high elevation alpine steppe rangeland of Changthang in Ladakh. Changthang is home to many nomadic pastoralists of the region out of which Changpas is one.

The Changpas have a long history of habitation in the region. They moved to the region in 8th CE from Tibet. With the coming of the modern era, they are witnessing change. Together with the changes and challenges to the environment, lives of Changpas are going through a constant process of change in terms of mobility, adaptability etc. They are not strangers to adapting to changes in their environment; the mobility inherent in a pastoral production system is a product of the community being fine-tuned to take actions based on the changes in their immediate environment. However, the process of modernization has had a profound impact on the lives of people living in the rangelands of Changthang. The changes that they are facing today are more significant and are likely to have long term effects on their way of life and the ecosystems they reside in.

A very diverse structure and composition is characteristic to Rangelands of the Himalayas. The Changthang Plateau in eastern Ladakh is located on the western extension of the Tibetan plateau (Goodall, 2004). This region is a representative example of a very important biogeographic province within the Indian trans-Himalayan region. The rangelands of the Changthang Plateau have a cold–arid ecosystem. Although these rangelands are considered resource-poor in terms of biomass production, vegetation cover, and floristic diversity, they support a high density of domestic livestock and a variety of wild herbivores. In recent years, ecologists and conservationists have questioned the sustainability of livestock grazing in these areas and the integrity of this ecosystem, given the rapid socioeconomic changes and steady increase in the population of livestock.

  

The study focuses on gaining a comprehensive knowledge of the changes happening in the physical environment, socio-economic, political and cultural aspects of the Changpas of Changthang Region from eastern Ladakh from 2001 to 2021. This knowledge is essential for defining the changing parameters of a pastoral environment. Pastoralism functions within a complex system balancing physical and anthropogenic change against environmental and socio-economic limitations. Ecological resources depend on the environment and the pattern of their usage. The changes to the region depend on the integral human factors and politico- economic factors from without. Both environment and pastoralists react to changing pastoral parameters such as pastoral mobility and economic forces; and this in turn impacts land cover, land-use and livelihood practices. At the same time due to inclusion into the modern state structure, their socio-economic and political fabric has been drastically altered. The decisions that the nomads take are dependent on the power structure they constitute and the changes taking place in the power structure due to the influence of the outside world. It is important to investigate how they relate to the narratives around themselves and how these narratives are changing. Therefore, it becomes essential to look into the question relating to the changing environment and changing power structure. Who defines nature and in what ways? The study looks into understanding the power relations in the region and the effect it has on the lives of the nomads.

# 2. Study Area Profile : 

The Changthang region in the Indian Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh represents the western extension of the Tibetan Plateau, an important highland grazing system. It is a cold desert, one of India’s five listed ‘biodiversity' regions, with a short summer and Arctic like winter, of sparse vegetation with a unique biotope, whose wetlands are recognised for indigenous and migrating birds and surrounding grasslands and marshes. Changthang sub-division with an area of 21,000 square kilometers, occupies a strategic position, sharing a border with both China and Pakistan. The cold desert-like landscape and vast plains of Changthang share the area and climate with the adjoining region of Tibet. It has an extremely short growing season, a short tourism period and remains covered under the blanket of ice and snow for six months in a year. 

  
Changthang accommodates 41 villages and hamlets, inhabited by about 11,000 settled and nomadic pastoralist populations. Tibetan Refugees, who crossed the border during early 1960 and remained within Indian Territory, joined the existing population. It consists of two administrative blocks – Durbook and Nyoma with 23 villages. Out of which 17 are in Nyoma block and 6 in Durbook. The area is restricted and outsiders need a permit to go beyond Nyoma. Due to the strategic position of the sub-division, there is a massive military presence. A well-maintained motorable road (highway) which passes through Nyoma traverses the area, facilitating the troop’s movement, which is stationed in Nyoma. (Bhasin, 2012).

## 2.1 Physical Environment

  

A. Physiography and Relief

  

Location

  

The region is approximately positioned between 75°50'E to 80°E longitude and 32°30'N to 37°N latitude, covering an expansive area of over 100,000 square kilometers (Sharma & Sidhu, 2011). Elevation varies significantly, from valleys and lakes situated at 4,000 meters above sea level to towering peaks such as Saser Kangri in the Karakoram Range, which exceed 7,000 meters. The Changthang region, meaning "Northern Plateau," is situated in eastern Ladakh and extends into western Tibet. This area belongs to the Trans-Himalayan region and lies strategically between prominent mountain systems. The Karakoram Range borders Changthang to the north, while the Great Himalaya Range forms its southern boundary. To the east, the region transitions seamlessly into the Tibetan Plateau. Geographically, Changthang spans from Durbook in the north to Demchok and Koyul in the center, and further eastward to Rupshu and Kharnak (Ahmed, 2004). Notable settlements in the area include Korzok, located near Tso Moriri Lake, as well as Nyoma and Hanle. Changthang is also home to the Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary, which is renowned for its unique high-altitude biodiversity.

  

Topography

  

Changthang’s landscape is defined by its rugged mountain ranges, sweeping plateaus, narrow valleys, and high-altitude lakes. 

  

• Plateau Formation: The region is part of Ladakh's high-altitude cold desert, characterized by vast rolling plateaus interspersed with low-lying valleys. These plateaus serve as critical grazing grounds for nomadic herders.

  

• Mountain Ranges: Changthang is framed by a network of parallel mountain ranges, including:

o The Zanskar Range to the south.

o The Ladakh Range, which separates Changthang from the Indus Valley.

o The Karakoram Range, marking the northern boundary. 

These ranges create a rugged terrain that heavily influences settlement locations and grazing routes (Sharma & Sidhu, 2011).

  

• Valleys: Key valleys in the region include the Indus Valley, which runs east to west through Ladakh, as well as smaller valleys carved by tributaries of the Indus and Shyok Rivers. These valleys are generally narrow, flanked by steep, imposing slopes (Jamieson et al., 2004). 

  

Changthang’s cold desert landscape is shaped by a combination of climatic and geological factors like Rain Shadow Effect as the Himalayan and Karakoram Mountain ranges block monsoon winds, rendering the region arid, Glacial Erosion as glaciers, both past and present, have sculpted the rugged terrain and contributed to the formation of lakes and Sparse Vegetation due to thin soil layers and harsh high-altitude conditions, vegetation is limited to sparse patches of grasslands and shrubs. The Changthang region’s unique topography, biodiversity, and climatic conditions make it a fascinating area of study, as well as a vital habitat for both wildlife and nomadic communities.

  

The pedological characteristics indicate shallow soils with suboptimal physical properties, predominantly sandy to sandy-loam textures exhibiting high percolation rates. (Bhasin, 2012)

  

Geology and Landforms of the Changthang Region:

  

The Changthang region, a cold desert, stands out for its unique geological and geomorphological features shaped by tectonic forces, glacial processes, and an arid climate. Below is an in-depth overview of its geological framework:

  

1. Cold Desert Rangelands

The Changthang landscape is characterized by vast rangelands with minimal vegetation adapted to harsh conditions. The soils in this region are shallow, low in organic content, and primarily sandy or gravelly, leaving the area vulnerable to erosion and desertification. Key vegetation, such as shrubs like Eurotia ceratoides, plays an essential role in stabilizing the soil and providing forage for both livestock and wildlife. Seasonal shifts in biomass availability greatly influence the ecological balance of these rangelands (Uniyal et al., 2005).

  

2. Mountain Systems and Valleys

The region is bordered by several parallel mountain systems, including the Ladakh Range to the north, the Zanskar Range to the south, and the Karakoram Range farther to the north. These ranges feature steep slopes and rugged terrains shaped by ongoing tectonic movements and glacial activity (Jamieson et al., 2004). Changthang’s landscape also includes longitudinal valleys like the Indus Valley, which often align with tectonic fault lines. These valleys illustrate the impact of structural deformation over millions of years. The sediments found here reflect a combination of fluvial and glacial activity (Sharma & Sidhu, 2011).

  

3. Landforms

Located in a tectonically active zone, the region experiences continued compression between the Indian and Eurasian plates, resulting in significant uplift and faulting. The thrusting of the Indus Molasse against the Ladakh Batholith has created valley asymmetry and shaped distinct geomorphic features. Evidence of past seismic activity can be seen in sedimentary deposits that exhibit liquefaction and deformation, further emphasizing the region’s dynamic tectonic forces (Jamieson et al., 2004).

  

The higher altitudes of Changthang are dominated by glaciers and perennial snowfields, which give rise to moraines, glacial lakes, and U-shaped valleys. Seasonal glacial meltwaters sustain the rivers and wetlands that are vital for the region’s biodiversity. Periglacial processes, such as frost heaving and solifluction, further sculpt the terrain at these extreme elevations (Sharma & Sidhu, 2011). Low-lying areas in Changthang feature sedimentary deposits from ancient lakes and rivers, offering insights into historical climatic and hydrological patterns. Aeolian processes, driven by strong winds, have created sand dunes and loess deposits in some parts of the region. These features reflect the arid and windy environment typical of Changthang. The distinctive geology and landforms of Changthang underpin a variety of ecosystems and human livelihoods. However, its fragile landscapes are highly susceptible to anthropogenic pressures, such as overgrazing and unregulated tourism. Protecting and understanding its geological integrity is vital for ensuring sustainable development.

  
  

B. Climate

  

The Changthang region in Ladakh has an extremely arid cold desert climate. It is known for its bitterly cold winters, very little rainfall, and noticeable swings in temperature both during the day and across seasons. Winters in Changthang are brutally cold, with temperatures plunging to as low as -30°C. Summers, while much milder, usually see daytime temperatures between 15°C and 20°C. These extreme temperatures are mainly due to the high altitude and the thin atmosphere in the area (Sharma & Sidhu, 2011). The region experiences sharp temperature shifts within a single day. Thanks to the clear skies and low moisture levels in the air, days can be relatively warm, but nights can still be freezing, even during summer (Pandit et al., 2024).

  

This region is situated in the rain shadow of the Great Himalayas, Changthang receives less than 100 mm of precipitation annually, most of which comes as snow in winter (Bhatnagar et al., 2006). Melting snow is vital for replenishing water sources like streams, lakes, and grazing pastures, which are critical for both wildlife and the livelihoods of local communities. However, changing snowfall patterns due to climate change are beginning to disrupt water availability (Namgail et al., 2010). Cold and powerful winds are a common feature of the Changthang plateau. These winds amplify the already freezing conditions and make survival challenging for both humans and livestock. With minimal vegetation, there’s little natural protection from the wind (Jamwal et al., 2020).

  

The high altitude also means stronger solar radiation. With a thinner atmosphere, the region gets high UV exposure, which poses challenges but has also shaped the way plants, animals, and humans have adapted to survive (Pandit et al., 2024). The harsh climate limits plant life to hardy species like shrubs (Eurotia ceratoides) and alpine grasses, which serve as critical grazing resources for livestock and wildlife (Uniyal et al., 2005). So, The Changthang region’s unique cold desert climate shapes everything from its ecology to the way people live. The combination of low rainfall, extreme cold, and intense sunlight defines its rugged landscape, limited vegetation, and the adaptive strategies of its inhabitants. As climate change continues to affect this fragile ecosystem, sustainable strategies will be crucial to preserving both the environment and the livelihoods of those who call Changthang home.

Temperature and Precipitation Patterns

Temperature and Precipitation, two essential elements of climate, limit growing season and considerably increase the difficulties of inhabitants of Ladakh. Temperature is extremely important in Ladakh, as, for the large part of the year, it remains low and there are high fluctuations in it. Cold weather starts from the end of October and extends up to April. Due to high elevation and the rarefied atmosphere, there occurs a high diurnal range of temperature in Ladakh. Rarefied air of the high mountains increases transpiration rates of plants which unfortunately curtails growth. 

  

The following graph shows that maximum monthly temperature in Leh district varies between 0.8ºC in January to 25.1ºC in July and minimum monthly temperature ranges from -13ºC in January to 12ºC in July and August. It shows that July and August are the warmest months whereas January and December are the coldest months.

As mentioned earlier, Ladakh is situated in the rain shadow area where moisture-laden winds are unable to reach in large quantities. This factor, along with high elevation and radiation of heat from bare surfaces results in excessive dryness. The following graph shows maximum precipitation received in the months of July and August i.e. 62.0 mms and 67.4 mms. Precipitation in winter months is mostly received in the form of snow. Therefore, almost all agriculture in the region is dependent on irrigation. Low precipitation, thus, acts as a constraint on the economic activities of the high altitude region of Ladakh.

C. Hydrography and Natural Resources

  

The Changthang region is characterized by its remarkable network of high-altitude freshwater and brackish water lakes, rivers, and marshlands. These water systems are vital for maintaining the region's biodiversity, serving as grazing grounds, and supporting the livelihoods of nomadic communities.

  

Major river flow through this region is the Indus River. The Indus River, originating from the Tibetan Plateau, is the region's primary waterway. It flows through Changthang, carving out valleys and enabling limited agricultural activities in its floodplains. Additionally, it nourishes several smaller tributaries and wetlands in the area. Smaller rivers, such as the Shyok, Nubra, and Zanskar, add to the region’s hydrological diversity. These waterways, sustained by glacial melt and seasonal streams, play an essential role in supporting both wildlife and human settlements. Major Lakes and Wetlands are Tso Moriri which is situated at an elevation of approximately 4,522 meters, this high-altitude freshwater lake is a haven for migratory bird species, such as the endangered, Black-necked Crane (Jamwal et al., 2020), Pangong Tso which is a stunning brackish water lake that spans the border into Tibet, celebrated for its breathtaking scenery and ecological importance and Tso Kar a brackish water lake designated as a Ramsar wetland of international importance, recognized for its rich biodiversity and as a habitat for migratory birds. This region is also full of numerous Wetlands and Marshes. Smaller wetland systems, such as those in Hanle, Chumur, and Shey, are essential grazing areas for livestock and provide critical habitats for wildlife. These wetlands also support the region's nomadic herders and avian populations (Sharma & Sidhu, 2011).

These areas have been traditionally used as grazing grounds by the local Changpas, and are now subject to increasing tourism.

  

## 2.2 Biological Environment

  

A. Flora

  

Rawat, G. S., & Adhikari, B. S. (2006) conducted a study on the grazing history of Ladakh, in the Rupshu Plains of Changthang. The study area for the purpose of the study was divided into two grazing units (Samad and Kharnak), which are the two traditional subdivisions of pastures in Changthang. The intensive study area lies approximately between 33°10 and 33°30 N latitudes and 77°55 and 78°20 E longitudes, and within an altitudinal range of 4400 to 5800 masl. There are two large water bodies in the study area, i.e. Tso Kar (about 19.5 km2, 4534 masl) and Tsarstapuk (about 2.5 km2, 4545 masl). Tso Kar is a brackish-water lake, whereas the adjacent Tsarstapuk has fresh water, drained by two perennial streams. The northwestern and eastern banks of Tso Kar are rich in deposits of borax and common salt and hence unfavorable for plant growth except for a few salt-tolerant species such as Axyris amaranthoides and Sueda microsperma. In other areas, soil texture varies from sandy and sandy loam to clay. According to Dhar and Mulye (1987), mean annual precipitation for this region ranges from 15 to 20 cm, 90% of which is snow. Mean minimum and maximum temperatures during the growing season (mid-June to mid-September) ranges between 2 and 30°C. Approximate minimum and maximum temperature for the year ranges between 35 and 32°C.

The vegetation of the study area can be broadly grouped into scrub formations, desert steppe, and marsh meadows. The major plant communities include caragana-eurotia, artemisia-tanacetum, stipa-oxytropis-alyssum, and Carex melanantha-Leymus secalinus. Very high altitudes (>5000 m) have sparse fell-field communities with mosses, lichens, and cushion-like angiosperms, e.g. Thylacospermum caespitosim, Arenaria bryophylla, and Androsace sarmentosa. The vegetation along stream banks and marsh meadows (except areas of borax and salt deposits) is dominated by sedges such as species of carex, kobresia, and scirpus.

As per the study, a total of 232 species of vascular plants belonging to 101 genera were recorded from the study area. Poaceae (39 species), Asteraceae (27 species), and Cyperaceae (25 species) were the dominant families. Based on the growth forms, these species can be categorized as graminoids (66 species), dwarf shrubs and undershrubs (16 species), aquatic and semiaquatic herbs (12 species), tuberous herbs (4 species), perennial herbs with thick underground root stock (40 species), woolly and cottony herbs (15), dwarf cushionoid herbs (22), prostrate herbs (32), and annual or biennial herbs (27).

  

Based on physiognomy, according to their study, four general categories of vegetation can be recognized in the study area. These are:

1. Scrub steppe (Caragana–Eurotia, Artemisia, and Tanacetum associations)

2. Desert steppe (Stipa–Alyssum–Oxytropis, Leymus secalinus, and Carex melanantha associations)

3. Wet and marsh meadows dominated by sedges under various associations

4. Fell fields dominated by cushionoid vegetation at higher altitudes (>4800 m)


According to Chaurasia, Khatoon and Sing (2008), the Changthang Valley is part of the desert vegetation zone of high altitude vegetation in Ladakh. This zone is characterized by little rainfall, low humidity, extreme fluctuation of diurnal temperature and high velocity winds. Majority of plant species have long roots and are succulent/ have small leaves. Common plant species which are growing around barren valley of Indus and Changthang are Polygonum aviculare, Atriplex crassifolia, Corydalis fl abellata, Caragana pygmea, Capparis spinosa, Echinops cornigerous, Ephedra gerardiana, Physochlaina praealta and Peganum harmala.

  

B. Fauna

  

In addition to the domesticated animal population of sheep, goats, yaks and horses, the area abounds in other animals as well. The wild herbivores in the study area include Tibetan wild ass (Equus kiang), Tibetan argali or nyan (Ovis ammon hodgsoni), Himalayan marmot (Marmota bobak), Tibetan woolly hare (Lepus oiostolus), Royle's vole (Alticola roylei), and pika (Ochotona sp.). The wild predators reported from the study area include snow leopard (Uncia uncia) and Tibetan wolf (Canis lupus chanko). According to Bhatnagar (2001), this area once formed the distribution range of wild yak (Bos grunniens) and Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsoni). Besides, the marsh meadows on the banks of both the lakes are used by a large number of migratory birds during the summer.

  

There are populations of threatened species, including Panthera uncia (Snow Leopard), Ovis ammon (Tibetan Argali), Pseudois nayaur (Blue Sheep), Procapra picticaudata (Tibetan Gazelle), and diverse avifauna. The wetland ecosystems serve as critical avian breeding habitats. Significant mammals include Siberian ibex, Ladakh urial, and kiang.

  

## 2.3 Cultural Landscape

  

Ladakh is the repository of ancient cultural heritage. It is the only place in the world where Tantrayana Buddhism is practiced as a way of life. People of Changthang region are deeply drenched in music, dance and drama which embody religious fervor. The culture of Changthangi people is an interesting mix of Tibetan and other customs. The Changpa are Buddhists and share cultural and linguistic affinities with Tibet (Rizvi, 1996). The main occupation of the Changpa tribal community is animal husbandry. Changpa nomads weave cloth from wool acquired from Yak and goats which has been a traditional occupation. Raising livestock seems to have been the main occupations providing clothing, shelter, and food. Having cheerfully adapted to the harsh weather and austere living conditions. The changpa society practiced fraternal polyandry where brothers usually married one woman as a way to restrict the number of individual households and avoid the division of limited property (livestock) and resources (Goodall 2003).

  

A. Cultural Heritage

  

The Changpa, nomadic pastoralists who originally migrated from Tibet in the eighth century A.D. (Jina, 1995), graze the rangelands of Changthang. The Changpa are Buddhists and share cultural and linguistic affinities with Tibet. The region's primary inhabitants are the Buddhist Changpa nomads, who have evolved sophisticated cultural adaptations to the extreme environment. Their social organization is based on the household unit (rebo), lineage (gyut), and clan (pha-spun). The community is led by a headman (goba) who manages grazing patterns and resolves disputes. Their subsistence strategy centers on pastoral nomadism, primarily involving yak, ovine, and caprine husbandry. The Changpas have developed complex social organizations and resource management systems over generations. The social structure follows patrilineal organization with distinct hierarchical stratification. Buddhist institutions, particularly monasteries (gompas), are integral to community organization. The Korzok gompa, established over three centuries ago, represents a primary cultural and religious nucleus.

The cultural landscape is experiencing significant transformation as Changpas increasingly adopt sedentary lifestyles or undergo urban migration seeking improved amenities. Nevertheless, their traditional ecological knowledge and sustainable resource management practices remain pertinent for regional conservation efforts.

Pastoral groups don’t live exclusively on animals and their products. They exchange animal products with other groups to obtain foodstuff and other necessities. Their food, social status and cultural practices are dependent on livestock they own. Traditionally, nomadic pastoralists of Changthang were also engaged in trade. They consumed a portion of animal products and bartered remaining products and traded in salt to obtain grain and other necessities like tea. Pastoralists, exclusively men, traveled with large flocks of sheep and goats loaded with salt, sheep wool and other livestock produce, to neighboring regions for trading. They used to collect salt from lakes in western Tibet and wool was a local product. (Rizvi, 1999).

  

B. Religious Aspects

The Changpas follow Tibetan Buddhism, but their religious practices also incorporate worship of local spirits. Their cultural practices are closely tied to their pastoral lifestyle, with rituals and ceremonies often involving livestock. 

The Chnagpas celebrate Losar festival and Guston. The Losar festival marks the beginning of  the New Year in Ladakh and is considered to be the most important festival of the region. There is also a celebration of the Dalai Lama’s birthday with feast and prayer in gompas (monasteries) . People also enjoy a good stage fight between the good and the evil. Every year the date and location of Losar change. Praying seems to be an integral part of their lives as most of them pray daily and very few days when not busy with the livestock activities. Most of them participate in local monasteries and religious festivals and wear their maroon Ladakhi dress called 'gonchas' that are made from coarse homespun woolen cloth. 

C. Economic Activities

Traditional economic activities encompass livestock husbandry, animal product processing and utilization, trading relationships with agricultural communities and halite extraction and commerce. The Changpas employ sophisticated pasture allocation and seasonal migration strategies to optimize resource utilization. Their traditionally self-sufficient economy, based on product exchange, has recently experienced significant transformation due to closure of the tibet border affecting traditional commerce, development of military infrastructure, expansion of  the tourism sector, integration into the market economy and government intervention programmes.

Economic activities in the region revolve around animal husbandry, primarily raising sheep, goats, and yaks. The Changpas produce and trade various animal products such as milk, meat, wool (especially pashmina), and hides. Traditionally, they engaged in barter trade with settled communities, exchanging their products for grains and other necessities.

They lost access to several traditional pastures on the Tibetan side when India and China fought a war in the region in 1962. Around the same time, the Indian side saw a heavy influx of Tibetan refugees (popularly known as TRs), who, like the Changpa, rear a variety of livestock including horse, yak, sheep and goat. These livestock types are adapted to the hostile and marginal pastures of the region, and provide a range of products and services. The domestic goats of Changthang reportedly produce the finest cashmere wool or Pashmina in the world (Ahmed, 2004). 

  

Historically, livestock production was the major land use in the area, as the high altitude and aridity did not allow agricultural production. Nevertheless in the early 1970s, some nomads started cultivating barley and green peas. In the beginning, these crops consistently failed due to harsh climate and the short growing season with frequent early frosts. The crops that managed to survive could be used only for stall-feeding in winter. However, in recent years improved varieties with shorter growth periods were introduced by the Agricultural Department, Leh, and this has enabled cultivation for grain as well as livestock forage. 

In recent decades, the Changpa economy has been affected by various factors including border conflicts, loss of traditional grazing lands, influx of Tibetan refugees, and increasing tourism. These changes have led to alterations in their traditional subsistence patterns and social structure. The region is now experiencing significant out-migration, with many Changpa families moving to areas near Leh for better access to education, healthcare, and alternative economic opportunities. This migration is changing the cultural landscape of Changthang and posing challenges to the continuation of traditional pastoral practices. 

  
  
  

# 3. Demographic and Socio-Economic Analysis 

  

This study examines the demographic transformations and socio-economic changes in the Nyoma and Durbok blocks over the decade 2001-2011. The research area encompasses 18 villages, with 14 villages in Nyoma block and 4 villages in Durbok block, each presenting its own distinct demographic patterns and development challenges. The study area represents a distinctive geographical and social landscape, characterized by high-altitude settlements that vary significantly in population size. These settlements range from small villages with fewer than 100 residents to larger communities exceeding 1,800 inhabitants. The region demonstrates complex patterns of demographic change, with certain villages exhibiting significant growth while others experience notable population decline, making these blocks particularly compelling cases for demographic research.

  

The following section provides an understanding of the six interconnected demographic aspects: population dynamics, educational patterns, workforce participation, social group distribution, household composition, and settlement patterns. Through this multi-faceted analysis, the study aims to identify key trends and patterns that can inform future development planning and policy formulation for the high-altitude region of Changthang, Ladakh. 

  

## 3.1 Data Organization and Processing

  

A. Data Sources and Data Treatment

  

For the purpose of the study secondary data has been used from the Census of India for the two decades of  2001 and  2011. No census happened in the region 1991 due to political instability. The data that was used was from the District Census Handbooks for 2001 and for 2011 as well. The data from Primary Census Abstracts for both decades was also used for a minimal demographic analysis. The Administrative atlas published by the census of India for Jammu and Kashmir in 2011 was used to gain an understanding of the administrative setup of the region, including the districts, tehsils and villages in question. A vast amount of Census data was explored before choosing the tables used for this study. Therefore, the analysis presented in the paper shows only a limited amount of understanding of the region as more work in the future would assure a well rounded comprehension of the demographic and social structure of the region.  

  

After choosing the tables, they were brought to google sheets to do the rest of data processing. The main concern was to find the common villages surveyed in both census decades. District Leh has 89 villages out of which Changthang consists of two administrative blocks. Nyoma block has 17 villages and Durbok block has 6 villages. However after comparing the two sheets only 18 villages were found to be common in the two decades. Therefore, Nyoma block has 14 common villages and Durbok has only 4 villages in common and these were used for the purpose of the study.

  

The research combines quantitative analysis of census data with spatial analysis of demographic patterns. The census records used provide information about population characteristics, literacy rates, workforce participation, social group distribution, and household composition at the village level. Each demographic variable was examined individually and in relation to other variables to understand both direct relationships and broader patterns. The analysis included the computation of various demographic indicators, including sex ratios, literacy rates, workforce participation rates, and household composition metrics. These calculations were performed at both village and block levels to enable multi-scale analysis of demographic patterns. The temporal comparison between these two census periods enables the identification of significant changes and trends in demographic and socio-economic patterns. The temporal analysis focused on changes between 2001 and 2011, examining trends in population growth, literacy rate variations, workforce participation changes, and shifts in household composition. The spatial analysis examined variations between blocks and among villages, identifying patterns of development and demographic change across different geographical scales.

  

Special attention was paid to the integration of different demographic aspects in the following analysis. This integrated approach helped reveal the interconnections between population dynamics, educational achievements, economic participation, social composition, and settlement patterns in the region. Understanding these relationships would be effective for development planning in the region.

In the current study the villages were divided into three types according to population sizes. The large villages have a population of more than 1000 people, the medium sized villages have a population between  500-1000 people and thirdly the smallest villages have a population of less than 500 people. 

  

Regional Overview: 

  

The demographic landscape of the study region exhibited complex transformations between 2001 and 2011, characterized by distinctive patterns at both block and village levels. The total regional population underwent marginal growth from 11,085 in 2001 to 11,118 in 2011, representing a mere 0.30% increase. However, this overt stability masked significant internal variations between and within blocks. There was an increase in the sex ratio of the region from 936 in 2001 to 1077 in 2011, indicating an increase in the female population in the region.

  

Block-level Population Dynamics:

  

The Nyoma block, with fourteen villages, experienced a population decline from 7,961 to 7,720 residents (-3.03%). This decline was accompanied by a substantial decrease in the male population from 4,141 to 3,669, while the female population increased from 3,820 to 4,051. This shift resulted in a dramatic improvement in the sex ratio from 922 to 1,104 females per 1000 males, representing an increase of 182 points.

In contrast, the Durbok block demonstrated positive growth, with its population increasing from 3,124 to 3,398 residents (+8.77%). The block experienced balanced gender-wise growth, with the male population increasing from 1,582 to 1,682, and the female population from 1,542 to 1,716. The sex ratio improved moderately from 974 to 1,020 females per 1000 males, an increase of 46 points.

The following table shows the total population for Durbok block during 2001 and 2011, including male and female populations, the sex ratio and percentage change in sex ratio. 

  

Village-level Population Distribution of Nyoma Block:

  

The settlement hierarchy in Nyoma block underwent significant reorganization during the study period. The largest settlement, Anlay, maintained its position with growth from 1,790 to 1,879 residents (+4.97%), while improving its sex ratio from 1,055 to 1,127. Karzok, the second-largest settlement, grew from 1,209 to 1,291 residents (+6.78%), with its sex ratio increasing from 880 to 918. 

  

Nyoma village experienced a significant decline, dropping from 1,179 to 918 residents (-22.14%), though its sex ratio improved dramatically from 733 to 1,149. This transformation altered its status from a large to a medium-sized settlement within the block's hierarchy.

B. HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE

  

Regional Overview of Household Composition and Structure:

The study region experienced significant transformations in household composition between 2001 and 2011. The total number of households in the region decreased from 2,516 to 2,165, representing a decline of 13.95%. This change occurred despite a marginal increase in total population from 11,085 to 11,118 residents, indicating substantial restructuring of household arrangements.

The average household size showed noticeable variation between the two census periods. In 2001, the 2,516 households accommodated 11,085 persons, yielding an average household size of 4.41 persons. By 2011, with 2,165 households supporting 11,118 persons, the average household size increased to 5.13 persons, representing a relative increase of 16.33% in household size over the decade.

The gender composition within households underwent significant change during this period. In 2001, the average household comprised 2.27 males and 2.13 females (5,723 males and 5,362 females across 2,516 households). By 2011, this composition shifted to 2.47 males and 2.66 females per household (5,351 males and 5,767 females across 2,165 households), reflecting both the feminization of the population and the trend toward larger household sizes.

The overall reduction in household numbers, coupled with population stability and increasing household sizes, suggests a trend toward household consolidation across the region. This transformation was accompanied by changing gender dynamics within households, with an increasing proportion of female members per household by 2011.

Block-level Household Patterns:

Nyoma Block: The Nyoma block experienced substantial changes in household composition between 2001 and 2011. The number of households decreased significantly from 1,859 to 1,561, representing a decline of 16.03%. Despite a population decrease from 7,961 to 7,720, the average household size increased from 4.28 to 4.95 persons, marking a 15.49% increase in household density. The gender composition within households shifted notably, from 4,141 males and 3,820 females in 2001 (2.23 males and 2.06 females per household) to 3,669 males and 4,051 females in 2011 (2.35 males and 2.60 females per household), indicating a trend toward feminization of household structures.

Durbok Block: The Durbok block demonstrated different patterns of household transformation. The number of households decreased from 657 to 604 (-8.07%), while the population increased from 3,124 to 3,398. This resulted in a substantial increase in average household size from 4.75 to 5.63 persons, representing an 18.32% increase in household density. The gender composition showed balanced growth, with males increasing from 1,582 to 1,682 and females from 1,542 to 1,716, resulting in a shift from 2.41 males and 2.35 females per household in 2001 to 2.78 males and 2.84 females per household in 2011.

Both blocks showed decreasing household numbers but increasing household sizes, though through different mechanisms. Nyoma block's transformation occurred alongside population decline, suggesting household consolidation, while Durbok block's changes accompanied population growth, indicating more efficient use of household structures. The increase in household size was more pronounced in Durbok block (18.32%) compared to Nyoma block (15.49%). Both blocks demonstrated trends toward more gender-balanced household compositions, though Nyoma block showed stronger feminization patterns.

Village-level Household Patterns - Nyoma Block:

In Anlay, the number of households decreased from 390 in 2001 to 371 in 2011 (-4.9%), while the population increased from 1,790 to 1,879. The average household size grew from 4.59 to 5.06 persons (difference of +0.47 persons), representing a 10.35% increase. The male population increased marginally from 871 to 883, while the female population grew substantially from 919 to 996. The gender composition per household shifted from 2.23 males and 2.36 females in 2001 to 2.38 males and 2.68 females in 2011. This pattern of decreasing households with increasing population and household size indicates significant household consolidation, particularly showing a trend toward larger, more female-dominated households.

In Chumathang, the number of households increased from 107 to 127 (+18.7%), alongside population growth from 509 to 641. Average household size increased from 4.76 to 5.05 persons (+0.29 persons), showing a 6.10% growth. The male population decreased from 301 to 237, while the female population nearly doubled from 208 to 404. Gender composition per household transformed dramatically from 2.81 males and 1.94 females in 2001 to 1.87 males and 3.18 females in 2011. Despite the increasing number of households, the growing household size indicates a pattern of household expansion rather than fragmentation, with a strong trend toward feminization.

In Demjok, the number of households increased significantly from 22 to 31 (+40.9%), while the total population remained nearly stable (79 to 78). Average household size decreased substantially from 3.59 to 2.52 persons (-1.07 persons), representing a -29.93% change. Male population decreased slightly from 44 to 43, while the female population remained constant at 35. Gender composition per household declined from 2.00 males and 1.59 females in 2001 to 1.39 males and 1.13 females in 2011. This pattern shows household fragmentation, with larger families splitting into smaller units despite a stable population. 

Himya village: The number of households decreased from 65 to 52 (-20%), while population remained relatively stable (267 to 265). Average household size increased from 4.11 to 5.10 persons (+0.99 persons), representing a significant 24.06% increase. Male population decreased marginally from 136 to 132, while the female population increased slightly from 131 to 133. Gender composition per household shifted from 2.09 males and 2.02 females in 2001 to 2.54 males and 2.56 females in 2011. This pattern shows strong household consolidation, with fewer but larger households maintaining similar gender balance.

Karzok village: The number of households decreased from 267 to 253 (-5.2%), while the population increased from 1,209 to 1,291. Average household size grew from 4.53 to 5.10 persons (+0.57 persons), showing a 12.69% increase. Male population increased from 643 to 673, and the female population from 566 to 618. Gender composition per household changed from 2.41 males and 2.12 females in 2001 to 2.66 males and 2.44 females in 2011. This demonstrates household consolidation with increasing household sizes and balanced gender growth.

Kerey village: The number of households decreased substantially from 86 to 60 (-30.2%), alongside population decline from 323 to 290. Average household size increased from 3.76 to 4.83 persons (+1.08 persons), representing a 28.69% increase. Male population decreased from 172 to 140, while female population remained relatively stable (151 to 150). Gender composition per household shifted from 2.00 males and 1.76 females in 2001 to 2.33 males and 2.50 females in 2011. This shows significant household consolidation despite overall population decline.

Kharnak village: The number of households decreased dramatically from 72 to 35 (-51.4%), accompanied by substantial population decline from 335 to 194. Average household size increased from 4.65 to 5.54 persons (+0.89 persons), representing a 19.13% increase. Male population decreased from 158 to 90, and the female population from 177 to 104. Gender composition per household changed from 2.19 males and 2.46 females in 2001 to 2.57 males and 2.97 females in 2011. This shows extreme household consolidation amid significant population loss.

Koyul village: The number of households decreased from 127 to 115 (-9.4%), while the population increased slightly from 486 to 493. Average household size grew from 3.83 to 4.29 persons (+0.46 persons), showing a 12.03% increase. Male population increased from 222 to 236, while the female population decreased slightly from 264 to 257. Gender composition per household shifted from 1.75 males and 2.08 females in 2001 to 2.05 males and 2.23 females in 2011. This indicates moderate household consolidation with a relatively stable population.

Mood village: The number of households remained nearly stable, increasing from 126 to 127 (+0.8%), while the population grew from 595 to 675. Average household size increased from 4.72 to 5.31 persons (+0.59 persons), representing a 12.55% increase. Male population remained stable (316 to 318), while the female population increased significantly from 279 to 357. Gender composition per household changed from 2.51 males and 2.21 females in 2001 to 2.50 males and 2.81 females in 2011. This shows household expansion rather than consolidation, with increasing feminization.

Nyoma village: The number of households decreased dramatically from 348 to 202 (-42%), with significant population decline from 1,179 to 918. Average household size increased substantially from 3.39 to 4.54 persons (+1.16 persons), representing a 34.14% increase - the highest in the block. Male population decreased sharply from 680 to 427, while the female population remained relatively stable (499 to 491). Gender composition per household transformed from 1.95 males and 1.43 females in 2001 to 2.11 males and 2.43 females in 2011. This demonstrates extreme household consolidation amid major population decline.

Samad Rakchan village: The number of households decreased from 98 to 71 (-27.6%), alongside population decline from 517 to 361. Average household size decreased slightly from 5.28 to 5.08 persons (-0.19 persons), showing a -3.62% change - the only village besides Demjok showing decrease in household size. Male population decreased from 280 to 188, and the female population from 237 to 173. Gender composition per household shifted from 2.86 males and 2.42 females in 2001 to 2.65 males and 2.44 females in 2011. This indicates population decline with minimal household consolidation.

Tarchit village: The number of households decreased substantially from 54 to 32 (-40.7%), with population declining from 237 to 167. Average household size increased from 4.39 to 5.22 persons (+0.83 persons), representing an 18.91% increase. Male population decreased from 119 to 83, and female population from 118 to 84. Gender composition per household changed from 2.20 males and 2.19 females in 2001 to 2.59 males and 2.63 females in 2011. This shows significant household consolidation amid population decline.

Teri village: The number of households decreased slightly from 32 to 31 (-3.1%), while population increased from 174 to 202. Average household size increased substantially from 5.44 to 6.52 persons (+1.08 persons), showing a 19.84% increase. Male population increased from 80 to 96, and female population from 94 to 106. Gender composition per household shifted from 2.50 males and 2.94 females in 2001 to 3.10 males and 3.42 females in 2011. This indicates household expansion with balanced gender growth.

Tukla village: The number of households decreased from 65 to 54 (-16.9%), while the population increased slightly from 261 to 266. Average household size increased from 4.02 to 4.93 persons (+0.91 persons), representing a 22.68% increase. Male population increased marginally from 119 to 123, and the female population from 142 to 143. Gender composition per household changed from 1.83 males and 2.18 females in 2001 to 2.28 males and 2.65 females in 2011. This shows moderate household consolidation with a stable population.

The analysis of household transformation patterns in Nyoma block between 2001 and 2011 reveals distinct typologies of demographic change, characterized by varying degrees of household consolidation and structural reorganization. These patterns can be systematically categorized into four primary transformation types based on the magnitude and direction of change in household numbers and sizes.

Category I: Intensive Household Consolidation 

A distinct cluster of villages - Nyoma, Kharnak, Tarchit, and Kerey - exhibited extreme household consolidation, characterized by substantial reductions in household numbers (ranging from -30.2% to -51.4%) accompanied by significant increases in average household size (ranging from 18.91% to 34.14%). This pattern suggests a fundamental restructuring of household composition, with Nyoma demonstrating the most pronounced transformation (42% reduction in households coupled with a 34.14% increase in household size).

Category II: Moderate Consolidation 

The second category comprises villages exhibiting moderate household consolidation, including Samad Rakchan and Tukla. These settlements experienced significant reductions in household numbers (-27.6% and -16.9% respectively) but demonstrated divergent patterns in household size transformation. Notably, Samad Rakchan presented an anomalous pattern with a marginal decrease in household size (-3.62%), contrasting with the predominant regional trend.

Category III: Structural Stability with Size Expansion 

A third category encompasses villages characterized by minimal changes in household numbers (±10%) but substantial increases in household size. This group includes Anlay, Karzok, Teri, and Mood, where household numbers remained relatively stable while average household sizes increased significantly (ranging from 10.35% to 19.84%). This pattern suggests internal household restructuring without significant numerical reorganization.

Category IV: Household Proliferation 

The final category presents a distinct pattern of household proliferation, observed in Chumathang and Demjok. These villages demonstrated increases in household numbers (+18.7% and +40.9% respectively), though with contrasting patterns in household size dynamics. Notably, Demjok exhibited a counter-intuitive pattern of household proliferation accompanied by significant size reduction (-29.93%), suggesting a unique demographic process.

Demographic Patterns Analysis reveals several noteworthy patterns:

1. A predominant trend toward increased household size, observed in 85.7% of villages (12 out of 14)
    
2. Progressive feminization of household structures across the majority of settlements
    
3. Asymmetric relationships between population changes and household transformations
    
4. Complex interplay between household consolidation and demographic composition
    

These patterns suggest a comprehensive demographic transformation in the region, potentially reflecting broader socio-economic changes, altered family formation patterns, and possible responses to external demographic pressures.

Village-level Household Patterns - Durbok Block:

In Durbok village, the demographic transition manifested through a moderate decrease in households from 173 to 160 (-7.5%), while population increased from 771 to 852. The village's average household size increased from 4.46 to 5.33 persons (+0.87 persons), with male population increasing from 381 to 416, and the female population from 390 to 436. The gender composition per household in Durbok shifted from 2.20 males and 2.26 females in 2001 to 2.60 males and 2.73 females in 2011, indicating moderate household consolidation with balanced gender growth.

In Man Pangong village, a unique pattern emerged with an increase in households from 159 to 171 (+7.5%), accompanied by population growth from 933 to 977. The village experienced a slight decrease in average household size from 5.87 to 5.71 persons (-0.16 persons), while male population remained relatively stable (456 to 459), and the female population increased substantially from 477 to 518. Man Pangong's gender composition per household transformed from 2.87 males and 3.00 females in 2001 to 2.68 males and 3.03 females in 2011, demonstrating household expansion with increased feminization.

In Shachokol village, households decreased minimally from 151 to 147 (-2.6%), while population increased significantly from 640 to 888.

Typological Classification of Household Transformation:

The analysis of household transformation patterns in Durbok block reveals three distinct typologies of demographic change. The first typology is exemplified by Tagste village, which demonstrated high consolidation characterized by significant household reduction (-27.6%) coupled with substantial increase in household size. The second typology encompasses Durbok and Shachokol villages, which exhibited moderate transformation patterns with modest household reductions (-7.5% and -2.6% respectively) accompanied by increased household sizes. The third typology is uniquely represented by Man Pangong village, which displayed an expansion pattern characterized by household number increase (+7.5%) while maintaining substantial household size. Cross-cutting Patterns revealed from the analysis:

1. Three out of four villages showed decrease in household numbers
    
2. All villages demonstrated substantial increases in average household size
    
3. Consistent trend toward larger household structures despite varying demographic trajectories
    
4. General trend toward more balanced gender composition within households

Gender-based Educational Disparities:

The analysis of gender gaps in literacy revealed both significant achievements and persistent challenges across the region during 2001-2011. The most notable improvement occurred in Nyoma village, which achieved the most substantial reduction in gender disparity, narrowing the gap from 26.70 to 6.04 percentage points. This was followed by Demjok, which reduced its gender gap from 28.38 to 15.08 percentage points, and Man Pangong, which decreased from 32.86 to 22.67 percentage points. Chumathang and Karzok also demonstrated significant progress, with gaps reducing to 7.93 and 7.47 percentage points respectively by 2011.

However, substantial gender disparities persisted in several villages by 2011. Tarchit maintained the largest gender gap at 30.60 percentage points (male 71.08%, female 40.48%), showing minimal improvement from its 2001 gap of 31.68 points. Kharnak showed a concerning trend, moving from a female advantage in 2001 (-7.83 percentage points) to a substantial male advantage in 2011 (30.06 percentage points). Himya, despite overall literacy improvements, retained a significant gender gap of 29.18 percentage points (male 81.06%, female 51.88%). These persistent disparities highlighted the continuing challenges in achieving educational equity between genders, particularly in certain geographical areas where traditional barriers to female education may remain strong.

E. WORK PARTICIPATION AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURE

  

Regional Employment Overview: 

The study region exhibited complex patterns of economic participation between 2001 and 2011, with significant transformations in workforce composition. In 2001, the region recorded 4,909 total workers (44.29% participation rate) out of a population of 11,085, comprising 2,666 main workers (54.31%) and 2,243 marginal workers (45.69%). The workforce showed distinct gender composition with 3,070 male workers and 1,839 female workers. Non-workers numbered 6,176 (55.71% of total population), with 2,653 males and 3,523 females.

By 2011, the total workforce increased substantially to 5,743 workers (51.65% participation rate) out of a population of 11,118, with 3,214 main workers (55.96%) and 2,529 marginal workers (44.04%). Gender composition showed significant improvement with 3,133 male workers and 2,610 female workers. The number of non-workers decreased to 5,375 (48.35% of total population), comprising 2,218 males and 3,157 females.

At block level, Nyoma block maintained relatively stable workforce numbers, with 3,752 workers (47.13%) in 2001 decreasing marginally to 3,682 workers (47.69%) by 2011. Male workers decreased from 2,292 (55.35% participation rate) to 2,077 (56.61%), while female workers increased from 1,460 (38.22%) to 1,605 (39.62%). The main worker proportion decreased slightly from 57.46% to 54.54%. 

The Durbok block demonstrated more dramatic changes, with total workers increasing from 1,157 (37.04%) in 2001 to 2,061 (60.65%) by 2011. Female participation showed remarkable improvement from 379 workers (24.58%) to 1,005 workers (58.57%), nearly achieving parity with male workers who increased from 778 (49.18%) to 1,056 (62.78%). The block also showed improved employment stability with main workers increasing from 44.08% to 58.52%.

Block-level Work Participation Patterns: 

Nyoma Block: In 2001, Nyoma block recorded 3,752 total workers (47.13% of population 7,961), comprising 2,156 main workers (57.46%) and 1,596 marginal workers (42.54%). The gender distribution showed 2,292 male workers (1,538 main, 754 marginal) and 1,460 female workers (618 main, 842 marginal). Non-workers numbered 4,209, with 1,849 males and 2,360 females.

By 2011, despite population decrease to 7,720, the block maintained 3,682 workers (47.69%), with 2,008 main workers (54.54%) and 1,674 marginal workers (45.46%). Male workers decreased to 2,077 (1,256 main, 821 marginal), while female workers increased to 1,605 (752 main, 853 marginal). Non-workers decreased to 4,038 (1,592 males, 2,446 females).

The workforce composition in Nyoma block showed concerning trends during 2001-2011. The decline in main workers from 2,156 to 2,008, coupled with an increase in marginal workers from 1,596 to 1,674, suggested growing employment instability. However, the block demonstrated positive trends in female employment, with women's participation in the main workforce increasing from 618 to 752, indicating improved access to stable employment opportunities for women. The reduction in male workers from 2,292 to 2,077, particularly in the main work category (1,538 to 1,256), pointed towards possible outmigration or shift to other economic activities.

In 2001, Durbok block had 1,157 total workers (37.04% of population 3,124), with 510 main workers (44.08%) and 647 marginal workers (55.92%). The workforce comprised 778 male workers (389 main, 389 marginal) and 379 female workers (121 main, 258 marginal). Non-workers totaled 1,967 (804 males, 1,163 females).

By 2011, the block showed remarkable transformation with total workers increasing to 2,061 (60.65% of population 3,398). Main workers increased substantially to 1,206 (58.52%), while marginal workers numbered 855 (41.48%). Male workers increased to 1,056 (754 main, 302 marginal), and female workers nearly tripled to 1,005 (452 main, 553 marginal). Non-workers decreased significantly to 1,337 (626 males, 711 females).

The Durbok block demonstrated remarkable economic transformation during the decade. The substantial increase in main workers from 510 to 1,206 indicated growing employment stability, while the more balanced distribution between main and marginal work suggested improved economic opportunities. The most significant achievement was in female workforce participation, with women's engagement in main work increasing nearly fourfold from 121 to 452. The reduction in male marginal workers from 389 to 302, coupled with increased main work participation (389 to 754), indicated successful transition to more stable employment. The significant decrease in non-workers, particularly among females (1,163 to 711), reflected successful economic inclusion policies.

These contrasting patterns between the two blocks highlight the complex dynamics of employment transformation in the region, with Durbok showing more successful outcomes in both employment stability and gender inclusion.

F.  SETTLEMENT PATTERNS AND URBANIZATION TRENDS

  

Regional Settlement Overview

  

The study region demonstrated complex patterns of settlement transformation between 2001 and 2011, characterized by changing settlement hierarchies and varying population concentrations. The analysis revealed distinct urbanization trajectories between the two blocks, with Nyoma showing settlement fragmentation while Durbok exhibited settlement consolidation.

  

Settlement Hierarchy Transformations

  

The settlement hierarchy in Nyoma block underwent significant reorganization during the decade. The number of large villages (population >1000) decreased from three to two between 2001 and 2011. Medium-sized villages (500-1000 population) remained constant at three, though with different constituent villages. Small villages (<500 population) increased from eight to nine, indicating a trend toward settlement fragmentation.

  

The Durbok block maintained a more stable settlement pattern, consistently housing four medium-sized villages throughout the decade. This stability in settlement hierarchy masked significant internal changes in population distribution and settlement characteristics, reflecting a more consolidated development pattern.

  

Population Concentration Patterns

  

In the Nyoma block, population concentration patterns showed significant shifts. Anlay strengthened its position as the largest settlement, growing from 1,790 to 1,879 residents, while improving socio-economic indicators such as literacy (39.72% to 53.65%). The second tier of settlements, including Karzok (1,209 to 1,291 residents) and the declining Nyoma village (1,179 to 918 residents), demonstrated varying trajectories of development and population retention.

  

The Durbok block exhibited increasing population concentration in its settlements. Man Pangong consolidated its position as the largest settlement, growing from 933 to 977 residents, while demonstrating improved development indicators including literacy (43.73% to 61.62%) and work participation (36.44% to 68.58%). Shachokol emerged as a significant growth center, increasing from 640 to 888 residents, with corresponding improvements in socio-economic indicators.

  

Development Indicators and Settlement Growth

  

The analysis revealed strong correlations between settlement size and development indicators. In the Nyoma block, larger settlements generally maintained higher literacy rates and more stable work participation patterns. Anlay, despite being the largest settlement, showed mixed development indicators with declining work participation (40.78% to 31.72%) but improved literacy (39.72% to 53.65%).

  

The Durbok block demonstrated more uniform development patterns across its settlements. All four villages showed consistent improvements in literacy rates, reaching above 59% by 2011, and significant increases in work participation rates, exceeding 55% across all settlements. This uniformity suggested more balanced development trajectories regardless of settlement size.

  

Settlement Sustainability Patterns

  

The analysis of settlement sustainability revealed varying patterns across the region. In Nyoma block, several small settlements showed signs of demographic stress, with Kharnak's population declining by 42.09% and Tarchit by 29.54%. However, some medium-sized settlements demonstrated resilience, with Mood growing by 13.45% and Chumathang by 25.93%.

  

The Durbok block exhibited stronger settlement sustainability, with three of four villages showing population growth. Shachokol demonstrated the most robust growth at 38.75%, while Durbok grew by 10.51%. Only Tagste showed decline (-12.69%), though maintaining improved social indicators despite population loss.

  

# 4. DEVELOPMENT IMPLICATIONS

  

Integration of Demographic Patterns and Development Outcomes

  

The comprehensive analysis of demographic transformations in Nyoma and Durbok blocks between 2001-2011 reveals multifaceted development implications. The contrasting patterns between the blocks - with Nyoma experiencing population decline (-3.03%) and Durbok showing growth (+8.77%) - have created distinct development challenges and opportunities that require targeted interventions.

  

Socio-Demographic Implications

  

The dramatic improvement in sex ratios, particularly in Nyoma block (from 937 to 1,078), accompanied by increased female literacy (27.55% to 45.28%) and workforce participation (38.91% to 43.59%), indicates a fundamental shift in gender dynamics. This transformation demands recalibration of development strategies to address women's emerging roles in the regional economy and society. The achievement of near gender parity in Durbok's workforce (48.76% female workers by 2011) provides a model for gender-inclusive development.

  

The changing household structures, with average sizes increasing in both blocks (Nyoma: 4.28 to 4.95; Durbok: 4.75 to 5.63), coupled with declining household numbers, suggests evolving social support systems. This trend necessitates adaptation in service delivery mechanisms, particularly for education and healthcare, to accommodate larger household units while maintaining accessibility for geographically dispersed populations.

  

Economic Development Patterns

  

The divergent economic participation patterns between blocks highlight the need for context-specific development approaches. Durbok's successful transition toward stable employment, evidenced by the increase in main workers from 44.08% to 58.52%, offers insights for economic development strategies. Conversely, Nyoma's shift toward marginal work (42.54% to 45.46%) indicates the need for interventions to enhance employment stability.

  

The varying success in economic transformation among villages within each block suggests the importance of local context in development planning. For instance, Man Pangong's remarkable improvement in work participation (36.44% to 68.58%) and Shachokol's substantial growth (+38.75%) demonstrate how demographic stability can support economic development.
  
# 5. Conclusion

  

This study of the Changthang region reveals a complex interplay between its unique physical environment and evolving socio-demographic patterns. The region's distinctive cold desert landscape, characterized by high-altitude rangelands, extreme climate conditions, and vital water systems including the Indus River and high-altitude lakes, has historically shaped the adaptation strategies of its predominantly Buddhist Changpa communities.

  

The analysis of demographic transitions between 2001-2011 demonstrates how these traditional pastoral communities are responding to modern challenges. Despite harsh environmental conditions and limited agricultural potential, the region showed notable improvements in literacy (40.68% to 54.87%) and female workforce participation. The contrasting demographic patterns between Nyoma and Durbok blocks - with Nyoma experiencing population decline (-3.03%) while Durbok showed growth (+8.77%) - reflect the varying capacity of settlements to sustain traditional pastoral livelihoods while adapting to modernization.

  

The transformation of household structures and settlement patterns suggests an ongoing negotiation between traditional pastoral practices and contemporary economic pressures. This is particularly evident in the shift toward consolidated households and the varying success of settlements in maintaining population stability. These changes, occurring within the context of the region's strategic location and unique ecological significance, highlight the need for development approaches that balance environmental conservation with the socio-economic aspirations of local communities.

  

The findings emphasize the importance of understanding both the physical constraints and cultural heritage of the region when planning interventions. Future development initiatives must consider how to preserve the traditional ecological knowledge and sustainable resource management practices of the Changpa while supporting their adaptation to changing environmental and economic conditions.
