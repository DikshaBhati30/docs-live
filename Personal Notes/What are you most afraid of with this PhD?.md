- What if I can not do it by the end of September?
	I will still live and breathe. 

- What if I disappoint everyone?
	Who?

- What if I never finish? 
	So? 

- What if my work is pointless?  
	Ohh, like life isn’t. 

- What if I never get my scholarship? 
	No, I can’t lose money to this govt.

- What if I stay a failure forever?
	If we live long, we succeed, that’s all. 

- What are you most excited about with this PhD? 
	When I first chose this topic, I thought working on this region would give me some peace of mind. Now, I am excited about the prospects of being Dr Diksha Bhati. I am excited about the world that opens up for me with a PhD degree in hand. I am excited about seeing the smiles on the faces of my loved ones at the convocation. I am excited to make my parents and partner proud of my achievement. I know it could not happen without them. I am excited to learn to work efficiently. I will be the Diksha I have always wanted to be. Someone with a means and an end. 

- What if I finish everything by the end of September?
	I will be the happiest person alive. I could move on in life. I can leave it all behind and be in peace. A part of my life that only ever put me down will be over. I can get married, travel, have kids, and love my baby forever. I can take on a real hobby. Learn to sing and dance and paint and cry and laugh and be crazy and adorable. I could actually have a home this time. A chance at a really beautiful life with Abhishek. 

- What if I make everyone proud (including myself)?
	A finished thesis would be best for my heart, soul and mind. Everyone who loves me is rooting for me. I am rooting for me. 

- What if I finish strong and with purpose?
	Once I have done good enough work, I can work on writing a book from my thesis. I can dive deep into the reality of things related to the thesis. 

- What if my work makes a real impact?
	After I publish my thesis, it might help someone years later, some lost scholar like me, see my thesis in a library and find the courage to carry on with life. 

- What would happen if this dream came true?
	I would die of happiness. I could not ask for anything more. I can get a teaching job if I like or start a company with the target population involved. I could help a community thrive. I could go on and give lectures about my work. I could join the government in its policy-making process.  

- And what if things work out even better than I imagined?
	I would be so proud of myself. My personal life will be more prosperous for the completion of this thesis. There is so much riding on it. 

- What if I get the scholarship, and it opens amazing doors?
	I can finally spoil my baby, my parents, and my brother. Get something for the kids in my family on all sides. They have all grown up so much, and I could never really get them anything. If I get the scholarship, I can do that for them. I can save some money for a grand piano for Abhishek. 

- What if I’ve never been a failure and am still becoming who I’m meant to be?
	I am grateful for my life. I know I will soon have some peace of mind.
