**Subject: Request for PhD Extension as per clause 5.3 of PhD Ordinance**

Dear Sir,

I, Diksha Bhati, PhD Scholar (Registration Number 1201014220 and Enrolment Number 19/63/MS/008) writing to formally request an extension for my PhD submission. I am currently working under the supervision of Prof. Vinay SP Sinha and Prof. Anuradha Banerjee at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development (CSRD), School of Social Sciences.

Due to the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent health complications I encountered, my PhD research and thesis submission have been significantly delayed. I was on a medical leave for a year to recover. All this has necessitated additional time to complete my doctoral work. 

I have been permitted for the PhD extension by the Research Advisory Committee meeting held at CSRD, SSS on 29th May 2025.

In light of the above circumstances and the committee's approval, I respectfully request you to grant me an extension of six months to enable me to complete and submit my PhD thesis. I am attaching the relevant documentation from the Research Advisory Committee meeting for your reference and records.

I would be grateful for your kind support. 

Yours sincerely,
Diksha Bhati 
PhD Scholar
